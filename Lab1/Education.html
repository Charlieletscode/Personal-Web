                <h2>Machine Learning</h2>
                <h3>
                    Linear regression. Maximum likelihood and maximum a posteriori estimation. Classification techniques, including naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, and support vector machines. Data visualization and feature extraction, including principal components analysis and linear projections. Clustering.
                    Introduction to neural networks and deep learning. Discussion of other modern analysis methods.
                </h3>
                <h2>Computer Organization</h2>
                <h3>
                    Introduction to the fundamentals and design of computer systems. Topics covered include computer instruction sets, assembly language programming, arithmetic circuits, CPU design (data path and control, pipelining), performance evaluation,
                    memory devices, memory systems including caching and virtual memory, and I/O.
                </h3>
                <h2>Advance Software Design</h2>
                <h3>Object-oriented software design for desktop applications with a graphical user interface. C# and Microsoft .NET programming assignments. Provides a solid foundation in modern programming for engineering and other applications.</h3>
                <h2>Learning from Data</h2>
                <h3>This course will focus on the following major classes of supervised and unsupervised learning problems: classification, regression, density estimation, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. Generative and discriminative data models and associated learning algorithms of parametric and non-parametric varieties will be studied within both frequentist and Bayesian settings in a unified way. A variety of contemporary applications will be explored through homework assignments and a project.</h3>
                <h2>Enterprise Client-Server Software Systems Design</h2>
                <h3>Examination of past, current, and emerging technologies. Client side technologies including DHTML, CSS, scripting, ActiveX, RSS, and proprietary applications. Legacy server side technologies including CGI, ISAPL, and active server pages. Current and emerging server technologies including ASP.NET 2, XML/SOAP web services, wireless and handheld access, WAP/WML, SQL databases, streaming media, CMS, and middleware. Design and implementation of solutions involving database connectivity, session state, security requirements, SSL, and authentication of clients. Small-team projects involving design through implementation.</h3>
